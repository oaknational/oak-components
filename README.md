# Oak Components

## Overview

This is a React Typescript components library which supports React and Next applications produced by [Oak National Academy](https://www.thenational.academy/). A Storybook for the components can be found [here](https://components.thenational.academy/) please consult 1Password for access.

## Installation

This library is suitable for use in an app using React 18 and Next.js 13.5+

You can install it using `npm i @oaknational/oak-components` or any other package manager that supports the NPM registry.

### Theming, global styles and fonts

For components to be styled correctly they will need access to a theme, some global styles and the Lexend font.

If you're using the Next.js App router your root layout should look something like:

```typescript
// layout.js 
import { OakThemeProvider, oakDefaultTheme, OakGlobalStyle } from "@oaknational/oak-components";
import { Lexend } from "next/font/google";

const lexend = Lexend({ subsets: ['latin'] });

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <OakGlobalStyle />
      <body className={lexend.className}>
        <OakThemeProvider theme={oakDefaultTheme}>{children}</OakThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

To enable SSR of styles and avoid a flicker of unstyled content you'll need to configure your Next.js app to support [styled-components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js#styled-components)

### TypeScript

If you're using TypeScript you might want to add `@types/styled-components` to your development dependencies (`npm i -D @types/styled-components`). This will ensure that all components are properly type hinted in your IDE.

## Development

1. Copy the example env config `cp .env.example .env`
2. Ask a colleague for the values to populate `.env`
3. run `nvm use`
4. run `npm install`
5. To view the storybook run `npm run storybook`

## Making changes

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Releases are managed by [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) and are automatically published to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oaknational/oak-components) on every merge to `main`.

Changes should go through a pull-request to `main` and require approval by at least 1 reviewer. You should seek reviews from a QA/designer/PM when necessary.

## Testing components inside a host app like OWA

Sometimes it isn't enough to develop entirely inside Storybook and it might be necessary to try local changes inside a target app. You can do this with [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc)

1. Install yalc `npm i yalc -g`
2. Run `npm run publish:local` to add the package to yalc's local registry.
3. Inside the target app run `yalc add @oaknational/oak-components` â€” this will install the package from the local registry like it would from NPM
   - ðŸš¨ if you're an Oak engineer developing in OWA there is a convenience script and you should use `npm run use-local-components` instead
     as it will perform some additional work to remove any existing installation of the package.
4. Now when you start your target app you should have access to the locally packaged version of the library
5. To uninstall the local package you can run `yalc remove @oaknational/oak-components` inside the target app
   - ðŸš¨ if you're an Oak engineer developing in OWA there is a convenience script and you should use `npm run remove-local-components` instead
     as it will automatically re-install the library from NPM.

## Structure

We're trying to follow the tenets of "Atomic design". [Brad Frost's book](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) is
a great resource if you're just starting out building your first component for this library. It's also a great reference
if you're in doubt as to where a component belongs (it can be a little fuzzy at times!).

Components are organised into a three tier hierarchical structure applying the following rules:

### Atoms

- Can import other atoms
- Imports from molecules and organisms are forbidden!
- Generic
- Unstyled
- Avoid embedded logic and state
- No sub-components
  (eg. `Box`)

### Molecules

- Imports from atoms components and other molecules
- Imports from organisms are forbidden!
- Generic
- Styled
- Avoid embedded logic and state
- No sub-components
  (eg. `IconButton`)

### Organisms

- Imports from atoms, molecules and occasionally organisms
- Combines multiple molecules together
- Applicable to a limited range of contexts which might occur in multiple apps
- Styled
- May contain embedded logic or state
- May be split into sub-components
  (eg. `SchoolInputForm`)

  NB. these rules are a work in progress. Modifications may be required as the library builds.
