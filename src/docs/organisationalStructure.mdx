# Organisational structure

⚠️ When creating a new component and in doubt of which category or folder it should belong to, discuss in #oak-components Slack channel.
⚠️ If you need to reuse a component which is inside a repo specific directory, it is your task to pull it into "Shared components".

## Shared components

- generic components or components used by more than one repo
- organised in the subfolders within 'Components' folder

### Current shared components subfolders

#### Typography

All typography related components

#### Buttons

All buttons and icon buttons

#### Form elements

Form elements including form elements styled as buttons

#### Images and icons

Components to render icons, images or SVGs

#### Messaging and feedback

Components which role is to display a message or provide feedback to the user

#### Layout and structure

Components which are used for creating layout

#### Navigation

Components which main role is navigation

#### Presentational

Components which main function is presentational

#### Cookies

Cookie related layouts

## Internal components

- an internal component is a non exported component which supports several shared Oak Components
- organised within 'Internal components' folder

## Repo specific components

- components built to serve a specific repo
- organised within relevant squad folders
- for new repo specific components, build them directly within a relevant repo; the current caveat is that if squad specific component imports any of the internal components which are not exported, it needs to be built within `oak-components` - in this case build it within repo specific folder
